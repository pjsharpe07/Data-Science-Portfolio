# Data-Science-Portfolio

The intention of this repo. is to display my progress through data science. Specifically showing the different projects that I have completed and the skills that I have gained.

Here is a quick summary of the different projects:

A-B Testing: A real-world data analysis that explores the reasoning to conduct an A-B test using Denver Public Schools student-teacher-ratio. 

Analysis - Gender Representation: A look using data analysis to communicate what changes have occurred in the representation of gender throughout the Marvel and DC comics.

San Francisco Health Scores - A supervised maching learning model that uses data mining for yelp information to predict restaurant health scores.
